# Mini Challenge 2

## Full CRUDS support

For the following criteria, "users" refers to non-admin users (users who would register through the sign up form we created).

### Acceptance Crtieria
1. Users should be able to create new posts.
2. Users should be able to view a single post at a time (a post's detail).
3. Users should be able to update existing posts.
4. Users should be able to delete existing posts.
5. Users should be able to view a list of all posts that have been created.

## Note
You will need views, templates, urlpatterns and more to make this happen. Make sure you have the right configuration in settings.py.
